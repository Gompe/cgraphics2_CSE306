# Assignment 2 CSE306

### Report

The report is in the pdf file CSE306_Assignment_2.pdf

### Fluid Videos

The videos can be found in the videos folder.

### Reproducibility

There are three main files in this repository: main_voronoi.cc, main_laguerre.cc, and main_fluid.cc. I provided 3 make commands in the makefile for compiling each of these 3 files. I am using the GCC compiler (g++) with C++17. 

When the file fluid.exe is run, the frames will be stored in a frames folder. *Notice that it may be necessary to create the folder manually*. I put the frames folder in the .gitignore file due to the space of the images. 

If you have FFMPEG installed, it suffices to run the python script frames2vid.py to convert the frames into a video. 

### Extra Labs

The tds 5 and 9 can be found in their respective folders.
